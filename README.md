## 👨‍🎓 About Me

Since I was a kid, I’ve been drawn to patterns—taking apart toys to figure out how they worked, solving logic puzzles, or decoding which teacher played Santa based on handwriting and subtle behavior. That early curiosity evolved into a deep interest in problem-solving and strategy, whether on the field as a college-level athlete or in my passion for rap music, where I developed a knack for recognizing structure and flow.

My academic and professional journey has been shaped by this mindset. I earned my Bachelor's in Computer Science from MIT-ADT, where I began working on predictive modeling during an internship at NIELIT. Later, at PHCDBS, I worked as a Data Analyst, handling biological datasets and building ML-driven insights. At eClerx, I designed ETL pipelines and interactive dashboards, driving operational improvements. I’m now pursuing my M.S. in Data Science at the University of Michigan–Dearborn, focusing on advanced analytics, machine learning, and scalable data systems.

What I bring is a blend of academic rigor, business context, and real-world execution—anchored by curiosity, strategy, and a deep respect for clean, actionable data.
